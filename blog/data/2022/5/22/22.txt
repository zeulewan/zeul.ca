I bought a yoyo. I want more physical toys so that I have things to do
during the time I would normally go on my phone. A yoyo is a pretty good
thing because I can continuously get better at it.

I got an e-reader from VV. The main reason I wanted one is 
so that I can hold it with one hand in bed easily.

I did the caulking on my bathroom. I have not idea why but the first time I did
the caulking I did such a bad job. I'll add some pictures here when I get a chance.

    I seperated all my blog posts from the index.php file (I started using PHP). 
    Then I made it automatically insert the date and apply formatting to each post. 
    I also made it so that all I have to do is type the name of the file I want to
    use for an image and it automatically inserts it. 
    It was quite hard to do all this, it included using loops switches and functions
    with recursion. The code is on my <a href="https://github.com/Zeulewan/zeulewan.com"><font color="#1187FC">GitHub</font></a> 
    if you want to take a look. I'll make a video explaining it all in detail. See ya l8r!
